# UtilityApp

## Introduction & Context

This is a repository created for my first assessment in CP3406 (Mobile Computing). This application serves to be a utility app, which fulfills some sort of purpose, no matter how mundane.

This application is built with Android, and to be used for Android devices only.

## Purpose

This application serves to give users weather reports, based on their current location, or through a town name that they give.

## Finer Details

The application will have a settings page, allowing users to choose from allowing the application to gain weather reports based upon location services, or through an inputted city name. The weather report will have an icon and some text, the icon reflecting the type of weather there would be. For instance, a sun would represent a sunny day, and vice versa. 

## Possible Additions

- Live notifications
- Widgets available on lockscreen & home screen
