# UtilityApp

## Introduction & Context

This is a repository created for my first assessment in CP3406 (Mobile Computing). This application serves to be a utility app, which fulfills some sort of purpose, no matter how mundane.

This application is built with Android, and to be used for Android devices only.

## Purpose

This application serves to give users weather reports, based on their current location. Depending on the weather, the app will give users some helpful advice, advising them on the best method of travelling through this weather. 

## Finer Details

The application will have a settings page, allowing users to choose from allowing the application to gain weather reports based upon location services, or through an entered postcode. The weather report will have an icon and some text, the icon reflecting the type of weather there would be. For instance, a sun would represent a sunny day, and vice versa. The helpful advice would also be text-based.

## Possible Additions

- Live notifications
- Widgets available on lockscreen & home screen
